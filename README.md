# HOTEL-BOOKING-ANALYSIS-EDA-PROJECT
## Hotel bookings depend on many factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week, meals available, parking spaces, charges etc. Hence analysing the patterns available in the past data is very important to help the hotels plan well accordingly in order to benefit the business. The given data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces etc, we tried to understand the customer’s’ behaviour and useful patterns in the data to help hotel managements improve the business by taking better decisions.
